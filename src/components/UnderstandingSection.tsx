            description="Autism is not simply a condition to be aware ofâ€”it's a different way of experiencing and interacting with the world. Autistic individuals possess unique perspectives, abilities, and ways of processing information that contribute to the rich tapestry of human neurodiversity. At Gurukulam, we move beyond awareness to promote acceptance, understanding, and celebration of neurodivergent minds."

            description="Autistic individuals may communicate differently, but their desire for connection and understanding is just as profound. Some may use alternative communication methods, require more processing time, or express themselves through art, technology, or other means. We create environments where diverse communication styles are respected and supported, fostering meaningful connections across neurological differences."
